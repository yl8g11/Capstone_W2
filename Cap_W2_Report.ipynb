            "source": "When people choose a new restaurant to try, they will often first go on-line to compare the ratings of several potential restaurants and then pick the one with higher rating to have their meals. In most cases, people tend to have very a high expectation for these highly rated restaurants. But the reality is that some of these restaurants may be overrated and the dining experience is not as pleasant as the website described. There are several reasons why a restaurant could be overrated. It might be that the restaurant is literally bad but happened to be rated by a very small group of people with high tolerance. It might also be due to intentional exaggeration by other raters for their own sake regardless of the restaurant's actual quality.\n\nOn the other hand, some restaurants may be underrated, even if they provide very good food and service at a relatively cheap price. When people just had a meal in these restaurants, they could only wish that they had known these restaurants much earlier.\n\nGiven that the on-line ratings might be misleading and could result in unwise choice of restaurants, it is important to build a system to detect the highly overrated and highly underrated restaurants around a location. Providing a list of these restaurants would benefit food lovers as they could avoid the overrated restaurants and try some of the underrated ones to have a better dining experience in the future.\n\nIn order to detect overrated and underrated restaurants, we are going to use the Foursquare API to **explore** the potential restaurants around a location (default is North York, ON). After getting their venue IDs, we will collect **venues** information of each restaurant, including **price**,  the count of **likes**, and their **rating**. Finally, we are going to utilize the multiple linear regression algorithm to make predictions to complete the task.",

The multiple linear function we get in the example of North York, ON, is: **rating** = 6.18032919 + 0.39078905 x **price** + 0.00811921 x **likes**.

            "source": "In order to predict restaurant **rating**, we use **price** and the count of **likes** as two independent variables. We argue that pricey restaurants tend to receive higher ratings due to higher food and service quality. And people also tend to give higher ratings to a restaurant that they have liked. Pearson statistics confirm our predictions, as we find that the Pearson correlation coefficient between **price** and **rating** is 0.34749699 with a P-value of 0.01934093 and the Pearson coefficient between the count of **likes** and **rating** is 0.51489608 with a P-value of 0.00029580.\n\nWhen fitting data of North York, ON, our multiple linear function is: **rating** = 6.18032919 + 0.39078905 x **price** + 0.00811921 x **likes**  \nThis model suggests that when the price jumps by 1 tier (e.g., from 2 to 3), the rating of the restaurant will on average increase by 0.39078905. Similarly, when one more user likes a restaurant, the rating of that restaurant is expected to increase by 0.00811921.\n\nOur results indicate that around nearly half of our sample restaurants are overrated (48.89%) and the other half are underrated (48.89%). When diving into details of those mis-rated restaurants, we find that Korean restaurants tend to be overrated while many Japanese restaurants are underrated.\n\nAn interesting phenomenon to notice on the map created by the **Folium** liabrary is that almost all top overrated and underrated restaurants in North York are on the Yonge Street. Given that Yonge street is one of Toronto's main streets, there is no doubt that its passenger and customer flow is very heavy. Therefore, a great mass of people with diversified backgrounds may find it hard to reach a consensus when it comes to rate their loved restaurants.\n\nAlthough our model works relatively well in making predictions using the current dataset, it is also subject to caveats. First, there may be other features that can also influence restaurant ratings but are not included as independent variables in our model. For example, the eating habits of local people are not captured by our model in making rating predictions. If the majority of local people love seafood, then seafood restaurants would receive higher ratings than, say, vegetarian restaurants. Second, the coefficients on **price** and **likes** may change when training the data of restaurants in other places of the world. Therefore, readers should interpret our results with caution.  ",
