## Welcome to My IBM Capstone Project Pages

In this capstone project, we try to detect the most overrated and underrated restaurants around a place (by default, we choose the location: North York, ON). 

We use the [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) API to extract the venue IDs of recommended restaurants in North York and then get details of each restaurant, including price, the count of likes, and their ratings.

We then fit our multiple linear regression model: rating = 6.18032919 + 0.39078905 x price + 0.00811921 x likes.

With the model we can estimate the predicted rating for each restaurant. A restaurant is classified as overrated if its actual rating is higher than its predicted rating, and deemed as underrated if actual rating is lower than predicted rating.
